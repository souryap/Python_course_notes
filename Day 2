#Tip calculator
#Below is the code I wrote

print("Welcome to the tip calculator.")
bill = input("What was the total bill? ")
tip = input("What percentage tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? ")
split_by = input("How many people to split the bill? ")

bill_with_tip = float(bill) * ((int(tip)/100) + 1)
per_person = round(bill_with_tip / int(split_by), 2)

print(f"Each person should pay: {per_person}")

# Later, modified the coding, seeing Yu's code
print("Welcome to the tip calculator.")
bill = input("What was the total bill? $")
tip = input("What percentage tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? ")
split_by = input("How many people to split the bill? ")

bill_with_tip = float(bill) * ((int(tip)/100) + 1)
per_person = round(bill_with_tip / int(split_by), 2)
final_amount = "{:.2f}".format(per_person)
print(f"Each person should pay: ${final_amount}")

lucky_numbers = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
friends = ["Kevin", "Karen", "Jim", "Jim", "Oscar", "Toby"]
print(friends)

friends.extend(lucky_numbers)
friends.apend()
friends.insert(1, "Kelly")
friends.remove("Jim")
friends.clear()
friends.pop() -> removes last element in the list
print(friends.index("Kevin")) -> to check if particular item is in the list
print(friends.count("Jim")) -> finds out, how many times this item "Jim" is in the list
friends.sort() -> it'll sort the list in ascending order
lucky_numbers.reverse() -> it'll reverse order of elements in the list

friends2 = friends.copy() -> it'll copy  the elements from friends

Tuples are immutable (can't be modified)
ex tuple:
coordinates = (4, 5)
